Hey! I'm Tam√°s Imets, co-founder and CEO of [Minyma Technologies](https://minyma-tech.com/). Started as an art student in high school but ended up expressing my creativity in engineering and tech business. Even though I don't write often and I don't think anyone will read these, this website intends to present my thoughts on tech, philosophy, astronomy, design, or whatever that comes to my mind. As a kid I really enjoyed publishing my electronic projects online, this site has a similar goal.

With our team right now we are building [Quino](https://quino.ai/), a study enhancement tool to help people learn faster. Some further links about my works and me: [CV](/uploads/cv.txt), [Minyma Technologies](https://minyma-tech.com/), [Quino AI](https://quino.ai/), [GitHub](https://github.com/Imetomi), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/imetstamas/).

Oh, feel free to recommend me some music!
