Extremely tall, dense buildings, colorful light shows on hundred meter tall buildings, crowded streets, humid weather, the sound of loud Chinese advertisements, an old lady preparing spicy noodles at the corner, and the smell of Sichuan chili. Walking on the streets of Chongqing is an experience like no other for someone who grew up in a small European town. In this short writing I will try to explain why this city attracted me, what motivated me to take the risk and pay a visit, and most importantly I will try to describe my journey of exploring this other-worldly aesthetic environment. I recommend [Love Theme by Vangelis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wBkKED42oo) to listen to for this essay.

## Why Chongqing?
Growing up I really enjoyed sci-fi movies and books, mainly because they all take us into a somewhat similar, yet very different world than ours. When it comes to science-fiction pieces I am much more forgiving on the story and characters and I expect a lot from the world the act is set in. Not like if I was such an expert critique, it's just what I like. For example some of my favorite worlds are presented in Blade Runner, Ex Machina, Altered Carbon, Neoromancer, Devs (series), and Ghost in the Shell. What's common in these is that is no supranatural force driving the events, only highly developed societies with large companies ruling over the bottom class. Certainly, this is not a setting one would want to live in but it is undoubtedly interesting to explore. 

A few years ago I came across this city called, Chongqing, probably on Reddit, way before it was popular on Chinese TikTok. Then it appeared in the Hitman videogame, started to gain some more popularity as the most cyberpunk city on the planet. I spent many hours watching videos of people walking around in the city, getting lost in ways I never imagined before and eating a lot of spicy food. Of course, I wasn't prepared for this trip but I felt as it it was calling me. I wanted to see with my own eyes what is an ultra-modern megacity like. I didn't care about the usual sightseeing and relaxation, I wanted to get lost in a new culture and learn a new way of living.  

## Motivation
Traveling to South-West China is not everyone's cup of tea and it's not your usual relaxing holiday. It is going to be a challenge for a foreigner. Chongqing is not like Shanghai, Beijing or Hong-Kong, there are very few foreigners here, you can't access the outside internet and almost no one speaks English. Needless to say, I was bit nervous but a challenge like this was exactly what I needed at that time. To calm myself I was preparing to this solo-trip by reading about great explorers like Hiram Bingham III (explorer of Machu Picchu, inspiration for Indiana Jones) and a personal role model, Alexander Csoma de Kőrösi. The latter is a man who originates from my home region and he is famous for being the author of the first Tibetan-English dictionary. What is even more interesting about him is that he spoke about 20 languages, and traveled from then Hungary, (now Romania) to India mostly by foot in the early 19th century. During his journey, he learned several languages, traveled with random caravans, was robbed, met British colonialists, lived in small prison like room for months and. Thinking about his life sends shivers down my spine. Reading about his story was the final kick to book the ticket to experience just a fraction of an adventure like this.
