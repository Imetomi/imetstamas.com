------------   EXPERIENCE AND PROJECTS   ------------  
I acquired most of my knowledge and skills outside of institutional education, which is probably due 
to my curious nature. I started working in the field of artificial intelligence and autonomous flying 
robots at the age of 16 and have been actively developing my ideas ever since.

- Brainwave-controlled wheelchair robot and videogame (1st prize at the 25th Youth Scientific and Innovational Contest)
- Intelligent human and face recognizing autonomous drones that can find injured people autonomously in rural areas. 
(Award winning project in Taiwan)
- Hand gesture-based home automation and smart home systems (SciChallange Winner - Vienna)
- Brain activity-controlled obstacle avoiding drones.
- Created a backtest environment in Python (using Pandas, NumPy and Plotly) with an interactive dashboard that 
allows to test and analyze algorithmic trading strategies with multiple instruments.
- Created a learning assist tool in 12th grade high school to help me with my studies, wasn't that good at that
time but it became the origin story of Quino (our edtech AI startup)
- Founded Minyma Technologies at the age of 22 with my friends
- Founded Quino at the age of 24 with the same team (raised a pre-seed round of >800k as a B2C edtech company in the CEE)



------------   WORK EXPERIENCE AND FREELANCER PROJECTS   ------------  
My earlier work experience comes from freelancer projects which I did mostly for Hungarian
and American clients. Most of these projects are related to embedded systems
programming and computer vision.
In 2021 I started a tech company and grew our team's size to 26 at one point. 
Right now I have two companies, Quino and Minyma Technologies. First one being a startup we focus a lot
on product development. The second one is our software service company where we solve deep tech related problems for our clients.

Soft Skills - More that 2 years of experience as a team lead, managing finances, HR and overall operations 


------------   WHAT DO I LIKE TO DO THE MOST?   ------------  
To be honest the best part of my work is probably early prototyping where you can explore a problem in really 
creative ways. This is the most joyful part of my work, combining design, computer science, and a motivated team 
to tackle these challenges.
